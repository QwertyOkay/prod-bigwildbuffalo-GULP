                <p class="modal__p">At PlayAndina, we stand behind the quality and performance of our gaming
                    controllers, gaming mice, pads, and keyboards. We are committed to providing you with products that
                    meet your gaming needs and exceed your expectations. To ensure your satisfaction, we offer a
                    comprehensive warranty policy. Please carefully review the following terms and conditions:</p>

                <p class="modal__p">1. Warranty Coverage: All gaming controllers, gaming mice, pads, and keyboards
                    purchased from PlayAndina are protected by a warranty for a period of 1 year. This warranty covers
                    any defects in materials or workmanship that may arise during normal use.

                </p>

                <p class="modal__p">
                    2. Warranty Benefits: During the warranty period, if you experience any covered defects with your
                    product, we will either repair or replace it, at our discretion, free of charge. This warranty is
                    valid for the original purchaser and is non-transferable.

                </p>

                <p class="modal__p">
                    3. Exclusions: Please note that our warranty does not cover damages resulting from misuse, abuse,
                    accidents, unauthorized modifications, or any other circumstances beyond normal use. It also does
                    not cover normal wear and tear, cosmetic damages, or consumable parts.

                </p>

                <p class="modal__p">
                    4. Warranty Claims Process: If you believe your product is eligible for a warranty claim, please
                    contact our dedicated customer support team. They will guide you through the claims process and
                    provide you with the necessary instructions. You may be required to provide proof of purchase and
                    any relevant documentation to support your claim.

                </p>

                <p class="modal__p">
                    5. Return Shipping: In the event that you need to return a product for warranty service, you will be
                    responsible for the cost of return shipping. We recommend using a reliable shipping method with
                    tracking and insurance to ensure the safe return of the item. Once the repaired or replaced product
                    is ready, we will cover the shipping costs to send it back to you.

                </p>

                <p class="modal__p">
                    6. Resolution: Upon receiving your product, our skilled technicians will assess the warranty claim
                    and determine the appropriate course of action. If a repair or replacement is necessary, we will
                    make every effort to expedite the process. Please note that the repaired or replaced product will be
                    covered for the remaining duration of the original warranty or a new warranty period, whichever is
                    longer.

                </p>

                <p class="modal__p">
                    7. Limitation of Liability: While we strive to provide the best warranty service possible,
                    PlayAndina's liability is limited to the repair or replacement of the defective product as outlined
                    in this policy. We shall not be held liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive
                    damages arising from the use or inability to use our products.

                </p>

                <p>Our warranty policy is designed to give you peace of mind and ensure your satisfaction with our
                    gaming products. If you have any questions or need further assistance regarding our warranty
                    coverage, please don't hesitate to contact our friendly customer support team. We are here to assist
